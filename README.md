## Introduction
The grain size of metals significantly affects their mechanical properties. This project focuses on measuring the grain size of aluminum and mild steel samples following heat treatment and polishing. The samples were etched and analyzed under a microscope. The Vickers hardness test was also conducted to determine the hardness of the materials.

## Materials and Methods

### Materials
- Aluminum samples
- Mild steel samples
- Sandpapers of various grits
- Polishing cloth
- Etching solution
- Microscope
- Vickers hardness tester

### Procedure
1. **Heat Treatment:**
   - The aluminum and mild steel samples were subjected to heat treatment to alter their microstructure.

2. **Polishing:**
   - The heat-treated samples were polished using sandpapers of various grits to achieve a smooth surface.
   - Final polishing was done using a polishing cloth to obtain a mirror-like finish.

3. **Etching:**
   - The polished samples were etched using an appropriate etching solution to reveal the grain boundaries.

4. **Microscopy:**
   - The etched samples were examined under a microscope to measure the grain size.

5. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - The hardness of the samples was measured using the Vickers hardness tester.

## Characterization

### Grain Size Measurement
Grain size measurement was performed using microscopy on the etched samples. The grain boundaries were analyzed, and the average grain size was determined.

### Vickers Hardness Test
The Vickers hardness test involved applying a diamond indenter to the samples under a specific load and measuring the size of the indentation to calculate the hardness.

## Results
The results of the grain size measurement and hardness test are as follows:

- **Grain Size:**
  - The average grain size for the aluminum sample was found to be 3.5 µm.
  - The average grain size for the mild steel sample was found to be 40.984 µm.

- **Vickers Hardness:**
  - The hardness of the aluminum sample was found to be 110 HV.
  - The hardness of the mild steel sample was found to be 170 HV at 200gf load.
 
- **Heat Treatment:**
  - The aluminum samples were subjected to peak aging heat treatment.
  - The mild steel samples were subjected to normalizing heat treatment.

Detailed results and data can be found in the [Results](results) directory of this repository.

## Conclusion
The project successfully measured the grain size and hardness of aluminum and mild steel samples. Heat treatment followed by polishing and etching allowed for clear visualization of the grain boundaries. The Vickers hardness test provided reliable hardness values for the materials, correlating with their microstructural characteristics.
